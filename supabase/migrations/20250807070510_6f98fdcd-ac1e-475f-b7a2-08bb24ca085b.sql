-- Step 1: Handle the confirmed booking using Testing Service
-- Since this appears to be real customer data based on the payment and details,
-- we need to update it to use a legitimate service instead

-- First, let's see what legitimate services are available
-- We'll update the booking to use TV Mounting service (most common service)

-- Get a legitimate service ID for TV Mounting
UPDATE bookings 
SET service_id = (
  SELECT id FROM services 
  WHERE name = 'TV Mounting' 
  AND is_active = true 
  LIMIT 1
)
WHERE service_id = 'c082fa14-599e-4569-9957-33ebcbe8ed9a';

-- Update the booking_services record to reference the correct service
UPDATE booking_services 
SET 
  service_id = (
    SELECT id FROM services 
    WHERE name = 'TV Mounting' 
    AND is_active = true 
    LIMIT 1
  ),
  service_name = 'TV Mounting',
  base_price = (
    SELECT base_price FROM services 
    WHERE name = 'TV Mounting' 
    AND is_active = true 
    LIMIT 1
  )
WHERE service_id = 'c082fa14-599e-4569-9957-33ebcbe8ed9a';

-- Step 2: Clean up any invoice items that might reference test services
DELETE FROM invoice_items 
WHERE service_name IN ('test', 'Testing Service');

-- Step 3: Remove the test services from the database
DELETE FROM services 
WHERE id IN ('871c1dc8-6fbc-4cf3-9aed-07c180c5f051', 'c082fa14-599e-4569-9957-33ebcbe8ed9a');

-- Step 4: Log the cleanup for audit purposes
INSERT INTO sms_logs (booking_id, recipient_number, message, status, error_message)
VALUES (
  'd51d626b-2411-4625-954d-2be2f079c441',
  'system',
  'Test services removed - booking reassigned to TV Mounting service',
  'sent',
  NULL
);
