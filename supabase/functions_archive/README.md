# Archived Supabase Edge Functions

This folder contains function directories that are not currently needed for deployment.
Archiving them prevents automatic deployment attempts and helps avoid exceeding the
project's edge function quota. You can restore any function by moving its folder
back to `supabase/functions/`.
