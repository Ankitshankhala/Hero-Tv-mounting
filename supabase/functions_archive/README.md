# Archived Edge Functions

This directory contains edge functions that have been archived to stay under the deployment limit.

These functions have been moved here as they were either:
- Not actively used by the current application
- Development/testing functions that aren't needed in production
- Redundant functions that have been consolidated

## Restored Functions
If you need any of these functions back, you can move them from this archive back to `supabase/functions/`.

## Current Active Functions
The active functions remaining in `supabase/functions/` are the core ones used by the application.
